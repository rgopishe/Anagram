Anagram- Jumble Solver:

The jumble puzzle is a common newspaper puzzle, it contains a series of anagrams that must be solved . If the final puzzle has multiple possible answers, then the algorithm should pick up the best possible answer based on the ranking in the dictionary . We have a dictionary where the "most common" English words are scored (1=most frequent, 9887=least frequent, 0=not scored due to infrequency of use). For each puzzle, the algorith produces the "most likely" final anagram from solving all the other anagrams

Getting Started:
Please place the freq_dict (the dictionary file ) in the desired path and make sure that you add that path in the python script as well.

Prerequisites:
Python2 or greater

Running command : 
python Anagram.py
